                                     Immutability:

        Should not change Object values once created

            Make class as final
            Make variables as private
            Make variable as final
            No setter method
            Make Deep copy for Object

                                  hat benefits we get due to immutability:

            Saving Heap Space
            Good for HashMap Key
            Good for critical operation
            Good for Multiple thread operation. Thread safe
