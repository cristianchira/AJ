/*                                       Abstraction principle (computer programming)

In software engineering and programming language theory, the abstraction principle (or the principle of abstraction) is a basic
dictum that aims to reduce duplication of information in a program (usually with emphasis on code duplication) whenever
practical by making use of abstractions provided by the programming language or software libraries. The principle is sometimes
stated as a recommendation to the programmer, but sometimes stated as requirement of the programming language, assuming
it is self-understood why abstractions are desirable to use. The origins of the principle are uncertain; it has been reinvented a
number of times, sometimes under a different name, with slight variations.
When read as recommendation to the programmer, the abstraction principle can be generalized as the "don’t repeat yourself"
principle, which recommends avoiding the duplication of information in general, and also avoiding the duplication of human
effort involved in the software development process.

    There are two levels of abstraction in Java:
        - Interfaces, used to define expected behaviour
        - Abstract Classes, used to define incomplete functionality.
