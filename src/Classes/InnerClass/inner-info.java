                                             There are two types of nested classes:

            non-static (inner class) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Member inner class
                Anonymous inner class
                Local inner class

           static nested classes

    Advantage of java inner classes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        1) Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods)
        of outer class including private.

        2) Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and
        interfaces in one place only.

        3) Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.
