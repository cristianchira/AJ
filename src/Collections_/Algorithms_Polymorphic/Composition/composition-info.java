                                              Composition

    The frequency and disjoint algorithms test some aspect of the composition of one or more Collections:

        frequency
            — counts the number of times the specified element occurs in the specified collection
        disjoint
            — determines whether two Collections are disjoint; that is, whether they contain no elements in common
