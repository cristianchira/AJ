    An interface declaration introduces a new reference type whose members are classes, interfaces, constants, and methods.
        This type has no instance variables, and typically declares one or more abstract methods; otherwise unrelated
        classes can implement the interface by providing implementations for its abstract methods. Interfaces may not
        be directly instantiated.

        • A nested interface is any interface whose declaration occurs within the body of another class or interface.

        • A top level interface is an interface that is not a nested interface.

    We distinguish between two kinds of interfaces:

        • normal interfaces
        • and annotation types
