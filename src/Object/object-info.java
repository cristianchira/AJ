/*                                             An object

    is a class instance or an array.
    The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects, and a special null reference, which refers
    to no object.

    ATest.A class instance is explicitly created by a class instance creation expression (�15.9).
    An array is explicitly created by an array creation expression (�15.10.1).
    ATest.A new class instance is implicitly created when the string concatenation operator +
    is used in a non-constant expression (�15.28), resulting in a new object of type String.
    ATest.A new array object is implicitly created when an array initializer expression is evaluated; this can occur when a
    class or interface is initialized , when a new instance of a class is created , or when a local variable declaration
    statement is executed .

    New objects of the types Boolean, Byte, Short, Character, Integer, Long, Float,and Double may be implicitly created
    by boxing conversion .

                                             What is state of an Object?

    Values assigned to instance variables of an object
